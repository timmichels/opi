# Maintainers

OPI maintainers do the work of keeping the project running.

Maintainers do the following things in support of OPI projects:

* Writing code for new features
* Writing code to fix bugs
* Opening bug reports
* Triaging bug reports
* Closing bug reports
* Reviewing pull requests
* Merging pull requests from contributors
* Resolving conflict found on pull request reviews
* Proactively dealing with technical debt
* Supporting documentation
* Guiding the projects strategic direction

In other words, maintainers are involved in day-to-day operations of the
project.

## OPI Maintainer Prerequisites

You should understand the [contributing](https://github.com/opiproject/opi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guidelines if you want to become a maintainer.

## OPI Maintainer Grant/Revocation Policy

An OPI maintainer is a participant in OPI who has the ability to merge pull
requests directly into main branch on OPI repositories. This ability grants
the maintainers the ability to affect the progress of the OPI project in a way
non-maintainers cannot. Being an OPI maintainer represents a significant level
of trust to the broader project. Maintainer rights are not granted lightly,
and will be reviewed as necessary to ensure that trust has not been violated.

### Granting Maintainer Rights

Granting maintainer rights will be considered when a candidate has demonstrated
the following in their interation with the project:

* Contribution of significant new features to OPI.
  * Submissions are free of obvious defects.
  * Submissions do not require many revisions.
* Consistent and meaningful code reviews of other people's pull requests.
* Helping others in the community via channels such as the mailing list,
  GitHub. Issues and PRs, and the Slack channels
* The individual should have plans for sustained contribution to the project.

The process to grant someone the maintainer role is simple:

* An existing maintainer nominates someone by sending a message to the
  maintainers slack channel.
* Existing maintainers discuss the idea of giving the candidate maintainer
  rights.
* After discussion has ended, existing maintainers will vote on approving the
  new maintainer.
* To recieve maintainership, the candidate must receive a majority of yes votes
  and zero no votes.
* One final discussion with the candidate happens to ensure the candidate is
  ready to accept the maintainer role.
* If successful, the candidate is added to the appropriate GitHub group to
  gain maintainer access.

### Revoking Maintainer Rights

When a maintainer acts in a way which is either detrimental to the OPI project,
it raises a situation which needs to be handled quickly to ensure the long-term
success and stability of the project. It is possible the maintainer in question
will have their maintainer rights removed. The process for this is as follows:

* Discuss with the individual privately about the concerns. Use email for this,
  sticking to the facts, and try to reach a resolution on the individuals.
  behavior. Ensure the individual understands their behavior needs to change.
* Send an email discussing the individuals behavior to the maintainer mailing
  list. Work to resolve the issue in this forum.
* If necessary, start a thread with maintainers except the individual in
  question regarding revoking the individuals maintainer rights.
* Each maintainer may vote yes, no, or abstain. Not voting is equivalent to
  abstain.
* After all votes are collected, to remove the maintainer, the vote must be
  a 2/3 yes vote in favor of removal.
* Any no votes should document their reasons for not voting to remove the
  persons maintainership.
* The person proposing revoking maintainer rights sends email to the list
  announcing the results.
* If the vote to remove is successful, the candidate will be removed from the
  GitHub group which has merge rights.
* Ideally, the revoked committer peacefully leaves the community. If this is
  not the case, the maintainers have documented the reason for removal above,
  and this can be shared with the broader community in support of their
  decision.
